LSculpt: Studs-out LEGO® Sculpture
==================================

LSculpt is a program which converts a triangle mesh into an LDraw file. Like the [sphere generator](http://lego.bldesign.org/sphere/), the generated model consists of a surface of 1×1 plates oriented in whichever direction provides the best detail.

Here's an example sculpture designed with LSculpt.

download
--------
LSculpt is currently available for Windows. You can download the latest version [here](http://code.google.com/p/lsculpt/downloads).

Interested developers may also take a look at the [source code](http://code.google.com/p/lsculpt/source). LSculpt is written in C++. The graphical interface uses the [Qt Creator](http://qt.nokia.com/) application framework. The preview window is powered by Travis Cobbs' [LDView](http://ldview.sourceforge.net/).

working with 3D models
----------------------

**finished models**

The bunny model shown on these pages is from the [Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/). A great list of models and model repositories is [available here](http://lodbook.com/models/). Happy hunting!

**converting between 3D formats**

LSculpt currently supports most [PLY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_%28file_format%29), [STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29), and [OBJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obj) files. If you come across other formats, you will need to convert them. * [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/), a free program for processing, editing, and converting 3D meshes * [3D Object Converter](http://web.axelero.hu/karpowh/), a graphical conversion utility between many 3D formats * [IVCON](http://lego.bldesign.org/LSculpt/ivcon.zip) (149 KB) Windows command line utility that converts between many 3D formats ([source](http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/cpp_src/ivcon/ivcon.html)).

**creating your own models**

Many programs can create files that will work with LSculpt. * Most [3D computer aided design (CAD) software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_3D_computer_graphics_software) can export to STL. * [DAZ 3D](http://www.daz3d.com/) and [Poser](http://poser.smithmicro.com/poser.html) can export Wavefront OBJ files.
